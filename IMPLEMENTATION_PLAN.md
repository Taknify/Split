- Create API endpoints for customer management
- Implement payment method storage and selection
- Test basic payment flows

### Phase 3: Virtual Card Creation (Week 5-6)
- Integrate Stripe Issuing API
- Implement virtual card creation flow
- Create fund pooling mechanism 
- Set up webhook handling for payment status updates
- Implement card status tracking

### Phase 4: Security and Testing (Week 7-8)
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Create monitoring for payment failures
- Conduct security audit
- Set up end-to-end testing

## API Implementation Details

### Stripe PayFac Integration
The PayFac (Payment Facilitator) model requires careful implementation:

1. **Platform Account Setup**:
   - Create a Stripe Connect platform account
   - Configure account capabilities for card payments and transfers

2. **User Payment Flow**:
   - Store users' payment methods securely using Stripe Elements
   - Use payment methods to charge individual users for their portion
   - Collect funds in the platform account
   - Create virtual cards funded by the collected payments

3. **Settlement Process**:
   - Track all charges and fund movements
   - Handle refunds and disputes
   - Provide detailed transaction history

## Technical Challenges

### Fund Pooling Mechanism
Creating a mechanism to safely pool funds from multiple sources:
- Ensure all payments are completed before card creation
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Maintain accurate accounting records

### Webhook Reliability
Ensuring webhook processing is reliable:
- Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate processing
- Set up proper verification of webhook signatures
- Create retry mechanism for failed webhook handling

### Virtual Card Security
Implementing secure virtual card handling:
- Generate and store virtual card details securely
- Implement proper access controls
- Apply appropriate card restrictions (expiration, amount, etc.)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual API routes in isolation
- Test Stripe API helper functions
- Test split calculation logic

### Integration Tests
- Test complete payment flows
- Test virtual card creation process
- Test webhook handling

### End-to-End Tests
- Test user journeys from expense creation to payment
- Test error scenarios and recovery
- Test cross-browser compatibility

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Payment Monitoring
- Track payment success/failure rates
- Monitor webhook delivery and processing
- Track virtual card creation success rate

### User Analytics
- Track user engagement with bill splitting features
- Monitor group creation and activity
- Analyze expense patterns

## Launch Preparation

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- Complete all critical features
- Ensure proper error handling
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Conduct security review
- Test payment flows in live mode

### Post-Launch Support
- Monitor payment issues closely
- Be ready to quickly address any payment failures
- Collect user feedback on virtual card experience
- Iterate based on initial usage patterns
